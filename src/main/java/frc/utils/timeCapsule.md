# time capsule
this document is meant to save as much info compiled over time by leaders and members of the nathan hale robotics programming subteam as possible. the main reson of this is to provide
 - a refrance of knowlage for current teams encountering problems
 - information to new members who find themselves without a teacher with experiance. (I have been there and it was not fun)

## preface
 - all links in text are also in 3. links
 - feel free to add any challenging problems and the solutions you found in the referance page **this file is meant to be edited**
 - dont remove something without a good reason
 - try to avoid adding things to referance that can be solved with a google search
 - version-specific info should include a version(ex. the dashboard wont work with negitive numbers in **v2024.1.5**)
## 1. referance
 - ### YAGSL
    - https://yagsl.gitbook.io/
    - not offloading offsets to encoders causes some problems, idk how, but i think its internal. seen in YAGSL v2024.7.0
    - loctite the magnets on swerve modules. this is very importent

 - complex and abstract systems/lockouts need an override in case of failure(ex. a lockout that prevents launching something until the launcher is up to speed needs a button or toggle in dashboard that allows launching whenever. otherwise if an encoder fails, you *cant* score)
